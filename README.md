General Project Guidelines
Project Scope:
• Your project should focus on implementing the core functionalities of the assigned
system. Ensure you understand the problem statement thoroughly and plan your
approach accordingly.
• The system must incorporate object-oriented design principles, including classes,
objects, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction.
User Roles & Access Control:
• Each project should include at least three distinct user roles (e.g., Admin, Staff,
Customer) with different levels of access and permissions.
• Implement a user authentication and authorization system, ensuring that users can
log in and access features relevant to their roles.
Code Structure:
• Organize your code using packages and classes in a modular fashion. Separate
functionality into different layers (e.g., business logic, data access, presentation).
• Follow SOLID principles and design patterns where applicable to maintain clean
and scalable code.
Database Integration:
• Your project should integrate with a relational database for storing persistent data
(e.g., users, transactions, inventory).
• Design and implement appropriate tables for different entities, ensuring proper
relationships (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many).
• Use JDBC (or an ORM framework) to interact with the database for CRUD
operations.
UI & User Interaction:
• Implement a simple graphic user interface for user interaction. Make sure the UI is
intuitive and user-friendly.
• Users should be able to navigate between different functionalities easily, and
actions (e.g., viewing data, updating records) should be clear.
Exception Handling & Validation:
• Implement exception handling for errors (e.g., invalid input, database connectivity
issues) to prevent crashes and ensure graceful error messages are displayed to
users.
• Validate all user inputs to ensure data integrity (e.g., required fields, correct
formats).
Testing:
• Write unit tests for the core components of your application to ensure the
correctness of your logic.
• Test each user role separately to ensure that permissions are correctly enforced.
Version Control:
• Use Git for version control. Make sure to commit your code regularly and write
meaningful commit messages.
• Ensure that your project is well-documented with README files, installation steps,
and usage instructions.
Documentation:
• Document your code using comments, explaining the purpose of each class and
method.
• Provide a brief description of the project’s architecture, including class diagrams if
necessary, to explain the overall structure of your code.
Team Collaboration (if applicable):
• If working in teams, assign tasks and ensure clear communication among members.
• Use collaborative tools (e.g., GitHub, Trello) to track progress and merge code
effectively.
